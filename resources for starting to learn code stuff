These are some resources I have used so far:

for learning python and some cool concepts using with python;

    * https://www.python-course.eu/index.php

to get fresh start to data science with python;

   * https://www.datacamp.com/  --> there is a data scientist certificate which would be good for absolute beginners.

for learning python, sql, javascript and other numerous techologies;

  * https://www.pluralsight.com/  --> I think the best source, the only disadvantage is not having any practices, only watching.
  
for learning web development, back-end and front-end;

  * https://www.freecodecamp.org/
